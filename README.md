## Todo Lists

- Code refactory, fonts.json refactory
- MAC 也可（字體簿），先 ignore， 但demo影片要有
- MAC font 跟 windows font 跟第三方 font 分開
- Edit the icon to fit 128x128 (96x96) as [reference](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/images?hl=zh-TW)
- Popup.html should use i18n, _locales/en/messages.json.
- Public_html should not, because the users can choose languages simply by clicking the nav.
- Do we really need the "還原所有設定" option?
- Publish to dashboard and test.
- 把自動套用抽出其他設定。把其他設定更名，功用一樣是防止按到還原所有設定至初始值
- Add Customized CSS Style functionality.
- Add REGEX functionality.
- Clean manifest.json after code refactory. [reference link](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest)
- change the CSS to mm3 style.
- A lot.
